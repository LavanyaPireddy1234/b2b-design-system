# Calendar Component

<Canvas of={CalendarStories.Default} />

The B2B calendar component is interactive and provides option to select a particular date, by selecting a day, a month and a year.
You can hook into an event that fires whenever the user selects a date from the calendar.

☝️ You should not add other interactive content such as links or buttons to the calendar.

☝️ Remember not to use the calendar just to display the dates, it is an interactive element and must execute an action when
clicked

NOTE: DisablePastDates, DisableFutureDates, DisableWeekends are optional. The component can simply be used like this without specifying any properties aside from the label:

<Source code={`<b2b-calendar></b2b-calendar>`} />

## Properties

### DisablePastDates

All the dates that are previous to the today's date of the calendar can be disabled, and those dates would render opaque and unclickable.

<Canvas of={CalendarStories.DisablePastDates} />

### DisableFutureDates

All the dates that are future to the today's date of the calendar can be disabled, and those dates would render opaque and unclickable.

<Canvas of={CalendarStories.DisableFutureDates} />

### DisableWeekends

All the dates that are weekends can be disabled, and those dates would render opaque and unclickable.

<Canvas of={CalendarStories.DisableWeekends} />

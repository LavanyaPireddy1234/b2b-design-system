# Using B2B Form Components

This guide aims to provide best practices for using our form components. More specifically,
getting the component's value, validation, form events and form submission will be covered.
For all of these topics, there are practical examples in [React](https://github.com/otto-ec/b2b-react-examples/blob/main/src/components/SignUpForm.tsx) and [Vue](https://github.com/otto-ec/b2b-vue-examples/blob/main/src/components/signupform/SignUpForm.vue) to consider.

<br />

## Form Component Values

The B2B components are designed to build on top of native HTML form behavior. This mean that
you can control the form's and it's children's state by setting the component's value. Similarly,
when the user types something inside an input field or checks a checkbox, it's value will be emitted
and can be processed further.

<br />

## Form Component Events

We're currently exposing three different custom events per component that are most relevant to reacting to form changes.
On top of that, all event listeners available on a native `HTMLElement` are available on our components as well. Note that
they are listening to the event on the top-most level and will not necessarily respond to events happening to nested elements
specifically.

☝️ We support Vue `v-model` for `b2b-input`, `b2b-checkbox`, `b2b-radio`, `b2b-textarea` and `b2b-input-list` components. You can
find more in [this
guide](?path=/docs/getting-started-vue--docs#v-model-support).

<br />

### B2B Input

The `b2b-input` event emits whenever a user types inside an input field, such as the search, the input or the textarea.

```typescript
interface InputChangeEvent {
  value: string | undefined | null;
}
```

### B2B Change

The `b2b-change` event emits whenever a checkbox is checked or a radio button is clicked.

```typescript
interface RadioEventDetail<T = any> {
  value: T;
  checked: boolean;
}
```

```typescript
interface CheckboxEventDetail<T = any> {
  value: T;
  checked: boolean;
}
```

### B2B Focus

The `b2b-focus` emits whenever the element gets focused. It emits the native event.

### B2B Blur

The `b2b-blur` emits whenever the element loses focus. It emits the native event.

<br />

## Form Elements width

All our form elements are defined with a width of a `100%`, which makes them expand as big as their container.

The width of any form component can be changed:

- directly on the component by adding an inline style
- directly on the component by adding a css class that defines the width
- wrapping the component(s) in a parent like a form or div, that define the width

Here is an example of different types of width used. Here we have a parent `div` that defines the width by inline
styles and a `dropdown` component that uses `fit-content` so that it does not expand based on available space but
content.

<Canvas of={InputGroupStories.story010Default} />

<br />

## Form Validation

### Inputs

We recommend using the `b2b-blur` event to validate text inputs wherever possible. This prevents layout shifting as users are still typing
and generally create a better user experience. We still provide the `b2b-input` for edge cases of this rule and to allow you to filter lists or outputs based on input though.

### Radio Buttons and Checkboxes

For elements like checkboxes and radio buttons we provide the `b2b-change` event for validation. It emits whenever the checkbox is clicked.

<br />

## Using the FormData Object

Creating a FormData object on submitting a form can be useful to send complex form contents to the server, because it can handle binary data such as files as well as text.
The B2B Form Components all support using this object.

The data can be accessed from the `<form>` event emitted by `onSubmit`.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    const handleSubmit = (event) => {
      let myForm = new FormData(event.target);
    }
    // Vue
    <form id="myForm" v-on:submit="handleSubmit">
    // React
    <form id="myForm" onSubmit="handleSubmit">
  `}
/>
